<h1 align="center">AB test for gamedev</h1>

The game has a special event – an event for which users can spend money. Designers have changed the appearance of storefronts to buy goods for the event. 
To evaluate the result of the innovation, it was necessary to conduct an AB test, dividing users into two groups: control and test. A test group with a new window type.

It remains to be seen which of the AB groups showed the best results.
